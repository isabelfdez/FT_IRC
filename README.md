# FT_IRC

The aim of this project is to create an IRC Server. Internet Relay Chat or IRC is a textual communication protocol on the Internet. It is
instantaneous communication mainly in the form of discussions in groups via discussion
channels, but can also be used for one-to-one communication.
IRC client programs connect to an IRC server to access a specific channel. IRC servers
are connected between them to provide a global network with unique channels.
